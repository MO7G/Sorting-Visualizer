# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer**! This interactive tool is designed to demonstrate the workings of various sorting algorithms, offering a deep dive into the mechanics of algorithmic sorting through engaging visualizations and competitive simulations.

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Includes Heap, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Radix, Counting, Bubble, and Selection sorts.
- **Adjustable Simulation Speeds:** Customize the speed of the sorting simulation to observe the algorithms at your preferred pace.
- **Animated Sorting Mode:** Watch the sorting algorithms come to life with engaging animations.
- **Race Mode:** Pit two different algorithms against each other in parallel to see which one completes its sorting task first.
- **Dark and Light Modes:** Choose between a dark or light theme for optimal visual comfort.
- **Huge Mode:** Simulate sorting on a large scale with numerous elements tightly packed together, perfect for observing sorting efficiency on substantial datasets.
